"""
Agent Security Demo — Prompt Injection & Guardrails Playground
==============================================================

An interactive tool that teaches AI agent security through hands-on
exploration of prompt injection attacks and defense mechanisms.

Key Concepts:
- Prompt injection attacks (direct, indirect, role-playing, escalation)
- Defense-in-depth: input validation, output filtering, constitutional AI
- Scope enforcement and human-in-the-loop
- Business impact of AI security failures vs. cost of guardrails

Modes:
- Demo Mode: Pre-built attack scenarios with simulated responses (no API key)
- Live Mode: Test guardrails against attack prompts
    - Ollama (local/open-source models): Real LLM calls with a deliberately
      vulnerable system prompt. Open-source models are more susceptible to
      prompt injection, so attacks often succeed — showing real breaches.
    - OpenAI / Anthropic (frontier models): These models have strong built-in
      safety training that resists most prompt injection even without guardrails.
      When guardrails are OFF, we use clearly-labeled simulated vulnerable
      responses so students can see what a breach looks like. When guardrails
      are ON, real LLM calls show the guardrails intercepting in real time.

No API key required for Demo Mode.
Live Mode supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama.

**Knight Capital (2012)** — A trading firm deployed code without proper guardrails. In 45 minutes,
a software glitch executed $7B in erroneous trades, resulting in a **$440M loss**. The company
went bankrupt. **Guardrail gap:** No staged rollout, no kill switch, no transaction limits.

**Rogers Outage (2022)** — A routine maintenance update removed a routing filter, taking **25% of
Canada offline** for ~24 hours. Interac (debit) went down nationwide; 911 services disrupted.
**Guardrail gap:** Risk was downgraded after early phases; no independent safety checks.

**Optus Outage (2023)** — A software upgrade caused a routing cascade that disconnected
**10M Australians** for ~14 hours. **Guardrail gap:** No circuit breakers, insufficient rollback,
monitoring failed alongside primary systems.

**Common thread:** Routine change + no guardrails = cascading failure. Autonomous AI agents
carry the same risks — guardrails must be *independent* of the systems they protect.

This demo simulates a **customer service AI agent** for "TechStore Online."
The agent has rules: protect customer data, limit refund authority, and stay in character.

| Tab | What You'll Do |
|-----|---------------|
| 🎯 **Attack the Agent** | Try six prompt injection techniques — see what breaks |
| 🛡️ **Build the Guardrails** | Explore five defense layers and test them individually |
| 💰 **Business Case** | Calculate breach costs vs. guardrail ROI by industry |

**Two modes:**
- **Demo Mode** — Pre-built scenarios with simulated responses (no API key needed)
- **Live Mode** — Test attacks and guardrails in real time:
  - *Ollama:* Real attacks against open-source models with a vulnerable prompt
  - *OpenAI/Anthropic:* Simulated breaches (clearly labeled) + real guardrail interception
