## The Big Picture: What Are AI Agents?

### From Chatbots to Agents

You're probably familiar with AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude. You type a question, and they respond. This is called a **single-turn interaction** — you ask, they answer.

**AI Agents** are different. They can:

1. **Break down complex tasks** into smaller steps
2. **Take actions** (search the web, write files, call APIs)
3. **Work together** with other agents
4. **Operate with minimal human intervention**

Think of the difference like this:

| Chatbot | Agent |
|---------|-------|
| Answers questions | Completes tasks |
| Single response | Multiple steps |
| You guide every step | Works autonomously |
| Like a reference librarian | Like a research assistant |

### Why Multi-Agent Systems?

Imagine you need a research report. With a single AI, you'd prompt it to do everything — research, write, and edit. The results are often mediocre because no single prompt can capture all those requirements.

**Multi-agent systems** solve this by having **specialized agents**:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ RESEARCHER  │ →  │   WRITER    │ →  │   EDITOR    │
│             │    │             │    │             │
│ Gathers     │    │ Transforms  │    │ Polishes    │
│ facts &     │    │ research    │    │ for clarity │
│ data        │    │ into prose  │    │ & accuracy  │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

Each agent has:
- A **role** (what they do)
- A **goal** (what they're trying to achieve)
- A **backstory** (context that shapes their behavior)

This is exactly what our demo does!

## What is Ollama? (Deep Dive)

### The Problem Ollama Solves

Traditionally, to use powerful AI models, you needed to:
1. Send your data to a company's servers (privacy concern)
2. Pay per request (cost adds up)
3. Have internet access (dependency)
4. Wait for network round-trips (latency)

**Ollama** lets you run the same AI models **entirely on your own computer**.

### How Ollama Works

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Ollama Concepts

**1. Models**
A "model" is the trained AI brain. Different models have different capabilities:

| Model | Size | Best For | Speed |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `phi3` | 2.3 GB | Quick tasks, limited RAM | ⚡⚡⚡ Fast |
| `mistral` | 4.1 GB | Good balance | ⚡⚡ Medium |
| `llama3.2` | 4.7 GB | General use (recommended) | ⚡⚡ Medium |
| `llama3.1` | 8.5 GB | Complex reasoning | ⚡ Slower |

**2. Server**
Ollama runs as a "server" on your computer. It listens on port 11434 for requests. When your app asks for AI help, Ollama:
1. Receives the request
2. Loads the model (if not already loaded)
3. Processes your input
4. Returns the response

**3. Commands**
```bash
ollama serve    # Start the server (required first!)
ollama pull     # Download a model
ollama list     # See your downloaded models
ollama run      # Chat with a model directly
```

### Ollama vs. OpenAI Comparison

| Aspect | Ollama | OpenAI |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Cost** | Free | ~$0.01 per demo run |
| **Privacy** | Data stays on your machine | Data sent to OpenAI |
| **Speed** | Depends on your hardware | Consistently fast |
| **Setup** | More complex | Just need API key |
| **Internet** | Not required | Required |
| **Quality** | Good (varies by model) | Excellent |

**When to use Ollama:**
- Learning/experimenting (no cost)
- Privacy-sensitive data
- Offline work
- Understanding how AI works "under the hood"

**When to use OpenAI:**
- Production applications
- Fastest results needed
- Don't want to manage local setup

## What is CrewAI? (Deep Dive)

### The Problem CrewAI Solves

Single AI models, even powerful ones, struggle with complex tasks because:
- They have no memory between responses
- They can't break tasks into steps autonomously
- They don't have specialized skills for different subtasks

**CrewAI** is a framework that lets you create **teams of AI agents** that:
- Have specific roles and expertise
- Pass work to each other
- Remember context within a session
- Work toward a shared goal

### How CrewAI Works

```python
# This is simplified - see the actual code in crews/research_crew.py

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# 1. Define specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    role="Research Analyst",
    goal="Gather comprehensive information",
    backstory="You are an experienced researcher..."
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Content Writer", 
    goal="Transform research into clear content",
    backstory="You excel at making complex topics accessible..."
)

editor = Agent(
    role="Editor",
    goal="Polish content for publication",
    backstory="You have an eye for detail..."
)

# 2. Define tasks with dependencies
research_task = Task(
    description="Research the topic thoroughly",
    agent=researcher
)

writing_task = Task(
    description="Write a clear brief from the research",
    agent=writer,
    context=[research_task]  # Gets output from research
)

editing_task = Task(
    description="Polish the written content",
    agent=editor,
    context=[writing_task]  # Gets output from writer
)

# 3. Create the crew and run
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task, editing_task]
)

result = crew.kickoff()
```

### The Agent Workflow

```

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Prerequisites Check

Before starting, verify you have:

- [ ] **Python 3.9 or newer** — Check with `python --version`
- [ ] **pip** — Check with `pip --version`  
- [ ] **8+ GB RAM** — Required for local AI models
- [ ] **10+ GB free disk space** — Models are large files

### Step 1: Install Ollama

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install ollama

# Or download from https://ollama.ai
```

**Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
1. Go to [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Click "Download"
3. Run the installer
4. Open a new terminal after installation

**Verify installation:**
```bash
ollama --version
# Should show something like: ollama version 0.1.x
```

### Step 2: Download an AI Model

```bash
# Download the recommended model (takes 2-5 minutes)
ollama pull llama3.2

# Verify it downloaded
ollama list
# Should show: llama3.2:latest
```

**What's happening:** Ollama is downloading a 4.7 GB file containing the trained neural network. This only happens once — the model is saved locally.

### Step 3: Start the Ollama Server

```bash
ollama serve
```

**Leave this terminal open!** You should see:
```
Couldn't find '/Users/you/.ollama/id_ed25519'. Generating new private key.
Your new public key is: ...
2024/01/15 10:30:00 routes.go:1019: INFO server config...
```

**What's happening:** Ollama is now listening on `http://localhost:11434` for AI requests.

### Step 4: Clone the Repository

Open a **new terminal** (keep Ollama running in the other):

```bash
# Navigate to where you want the project
cd ~/Projects  # or wherever you prefer

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dlwhyte/AgenticAI_foundry.git

# Enter the directory
cd AgenticAI_foundry
```

### Step 5: Set Up Python Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Your prompt should now show (venv)
```

### Step 6: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install base requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install CrewAI and Ollama support
pip install crewai langchain-community
```

### Step 7: Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Check that Ollama is accessible
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Should return JSON with your models

# Or use our built-in check
python -m crews.research_crew --check
```

You should see:
```
🔍 Checking provider availability...

  ✅ 🏠 Ollama (Local)
      └─ Ollama is running
      └─ llama3.2 model available
  ✅ ☁️ OpenAI
      └─ ⚠️  No API key. Set OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Step 8: Launch the App

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

Your browser should open to `http://localhost:8501`. Click **"Multi-Agent Demo"** in the sidebar!

---

## Running Your First Multi-Agent Task

### Using the Streamlit Interface

1. **Select Provider:** Choose "🏠 Ollama (Local)" in the sidebar
2. **Enter a Topic:** Try something like:
   - "Research the impact of AI on healthcare"
   - "Explain quantum computing for business leaders"
   - "Summarize recent developments in renewable energy"
3. **Click "🚀 Run Research Crew"**
4. **Watch the agents work!**

### Using the Command Line

For more control, use the CLI directly:

```bash
# Basic usage
python -m crews.research_crew --provider ollama --task "Research AI in education"

# See what's happening (verbose mode is on by default)
python -m crews.research_crew --provider ollama --task "Explain blockchain"

# Quiet mode (just the result)
python -m crews.research_crew --provider ollama --task "Topic" --quiet
```

## Troubleshooting for Beginners

### "Ollama not running"

**Symptom:** Error says Ollama isn't available

**Fix:**
```bash
# In a separate terminal:
ollama serve

# Keep it running while using the demo
```

### "Model not found"

**Symptom:** Error about missing model

**Fix:**
```bash
# Download the model
ollama pull llama3.2

# Verify it's there
ollama list
```

### "Out of memory"

**Symptom:** Computer freezes or error about memory

**Fix:**
1. Close other applications
2. Try a smaller model:
```bash
ollama pull phi3
# Then select phi3 in the demo or use --model phi3
```

### "Very slow responses"

**Symptom:** Taking many minutes per agent

**This is normal for local models!** Tips:
- First run is slowest (loading model)
- Smaller models are faster (`phi3` vs `llama3.1`)
- GPU acceleration helps dramatically
- Consider OpenAI for speed-critical work

### "Import errors"

**Symptom:** Python can't find modules

**Fix:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd AgenticAI_foundry

# Make sure venv is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install crewai langchain-community
```

### "Permission denied"

**Symptom:** Can't run scripts or access files

**Fix (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
chmod +x ollama  # If needed for Ollama
```

**Fix (Windows):**
- Run terminal as Administrator
- Check antivirus isn't blocking
